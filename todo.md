# General code cleanliness
 - [x] use IVec3 in places where it makes sense (like everywhere)

# Big feautures
 - [ ] Player and AI interaction 
    - [ ] ladders
    - [ ] guns
    - [ ] cannons
    - [ ] swords
    - [ ] player and AI view and memory simulation
 - [ ] tile rendering and sprite features
    - [ ] Custom spritesheet somehow
    - [ ] cull sprites on other layers.
       - [ ] add camera viewports for events above/below 
       - [ ] let player look around
    - [ ] spritesheet preproccessing\(?)
    - [ ] dynamically update spritesheet colors
    - [ ] dynamically update tile sprites
 - [ ] "full" tile physics engine
  - [ ] linked velocities
  - [ ] "take" velocity from floor
  - [ ] finalize continous velocity
  - [ ] fine tune gravity
 - [ ] ships
    - requires certain spritesheet features
    - [ ] ship rotate along z axis with half-steps
    - [ ] steering
    - [ ] holes/sinking
    - [ ] generated treasure?
 - [ ] enemy and friendly AI
    - [ ] teams
    - [ ] AIs have different strengths
    - [ ] AI self-preservation systems
    - [ ] AI gives and takes commands
    - [ ] should be able to use same interactions as player
